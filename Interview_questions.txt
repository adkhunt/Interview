1) Design time based job scheduler.
eg. User submits the job j with time t, scheduler should shedule that job after given t time.
    Input:  schedule_job (printf("Hi, start"), 6000L) // pritnf is the task and 6000 is the milisecond time.
            schedule_job (printf("Hello, start", 2000L))
            sleep(3);
            schedule_job (printf ("Bye"), 4000L)
            
    Output: Hello, start
            Hi, start
            Bye
            
            
2) Design garbage collector in cloud storage.
  Eg. There is a public cloud, In that cloud user can push any number of files and storage is limited. So design a service which will
      delete files after given time.
      Lets say in folder f, user copied files and configured time by cloud provider is 5 days. After 5 days whatever files/folders
      were created needs to deleted by service.
      
3) Design library (Standard question).
4) Design malloc in OS.
5) Reverse of question-1. Design a scheduler which takes process P and time T as argument and schedule that process normally.
   After T time that process should get killed by scheduler.
6) Design a insert and get method. Insert will take filename, key and value. given key and value needs to inserted to given file.
   Get method will take key and find that key from files and return the corresponding value to that key.
   Constrains: There could be thousands of files.
    Eg. insert(file, key, value)
        get (key)
    
7) Design a centralised system which can take care of installation of services on multiple targets.
    Eg. There is a one management platform like vCenter where multiple ESXi are connected to it. Need to design a system in
        vCenter which can take care of installation of service on all the ESXi servers.
    --> Need to take care of take care of vm migration and storage migration if that service needs reboot of ESXi.

9) Array of integer denotes the wheels, WAP to print the number of ways to provide the solution.
   Eg. Array of integer as below,
       6, 8, 10, 3    <-- Which denotes the number of wheel. You have two option either you can have 2-wheeler or 4-wheeler so below could be the solution,
       2, 3, 3, 0
       When we have 6 wheels we can solve it as below,
       1. We can have 3 2-wheelers.
       2. We can have one 4-wheeler and one 2-wheeler.
       So answer for 6 is 2.
       When we have 3 in that case we can not provide any solution so answer is 0.
       
10) You are given a encoded string and WAP to decode that string.
    Eg, my name is -> mnes--ya-----mi -> my name is (In below matrix arranged the character in diagonal position.)
        m  n  e  s  _
        _  y  a  _  _
        _  _  _  m  i
        
    In above string you will be given the number of raw with encoded string and have to decode the string.
    
11) Delete Nth node from end in linklist.
    Eg. 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL, N = 2
       Op: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> NULL
       
12) Given multiple source files, WAP to resolve depedency of those source files. (Topological sort)
13) Design data-structure which can perform all(Insert, delete, search, getRandom) operation in O(1) time.
14) Given a matrix with 0 and 1, where 0 indicate space and 1 indicate wall. Given starting and ending location. WAP if from starting location ball can reach to end     location.
    Constrain: Ball only can turn once it hits to wall.
    Eg. 1 1 0 0   -> Start location (0, 3) end location (3, 3)
        1 0 0 0
        1 0 1 1
        1 0 0 0
        
15) Given a hierarchy of organisation, WAP to find closest manager of given two employee.
