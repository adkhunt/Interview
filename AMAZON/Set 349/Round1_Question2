/*
 * Design the data structure where data 
 * can access, delete and random access in 
 * constant time
 */

For this we can use the Hashmap which support the insert, delete
and get in constant time but to get random we use the size of hashmap
so we get the random number from 0 to size by using the rand function
after that we will return the random index which we get from rand function
so by this way all the operation we can get the constant time
